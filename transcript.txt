We know performed one of the major tasks in programming called the looping, we told you
how we can make our cat reside the multiplication tables, well we made our cat do some
mental exercise you see it is time for us to make her do some physical exercise. We will make
her move back and forth by using our programming skills. Ok, friends see I have written a
very long code, very patiently I have tried writing this code what exactly is this code? Look at
this, initially I am going to move twenty steps take a half a second break there and then come
back twenty steps, half a second pause go ahead forty steps see it’s like first day cat moves
twenty steps and comes back next it goes forty steps and comes back sixty steps comes back
minus sixty steps, eighty steps and then comes back and so on as you can see so on so on, so
on, move hundred, minus hundred move one twenty and then minus one twenty which means
come back move one forty and then come back one sixty, one eighty, two hundred and then
come back as you would have guessed, if you have guessed this cat will now keep moving
ahead like this incrementally will get bolder and bolder and move away from her house, she
will try going as far as possible, let’s see how this works by double clicking on this. Double
click; ahead back, back, ahead back go ahead back, go bolder and bolder go twenty steps
ahead twenty steps ahead and finally stop once you reach two hundred steps. Correct? Let’s
do this once again and then watch one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and ten so
twenty steps, two hundred steps which is ten perfect, now I have a question for you all, she is
doing basically ten ahead’s and ten backs in succession right, is there any way I can use a
repeat loop and then put something so that the same thing can be achieved by making her by
do something ten times without going through this ordeal of writing this big of code, now
what am I trying to say, is there any way you can use this and reduce this to a smaller code,
because its looks like we are repeating the same stuff but these values are changing correct?
How do we go about it? Can you now figure out by looking at all the options here, if you can
do this all by yourself, we strongly suggest that you spend at least fifteen to twenty minutes
time figuring out, how you can achieve the same thing using the repeat loop, if you cannot
solve it get back and continue watching the videos.
